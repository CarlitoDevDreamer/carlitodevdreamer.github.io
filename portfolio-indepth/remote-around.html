          <h2><a href="#acc1">Purpose:</a></h2>
          <p>Remote Arround is a curated platform designed to connect professionals with innovative companies offering remote, hybrid, and non-remote job opportunities. The primary purpose of the website is to streamline the job search process for individuals seeking independent positions in various professional career areas. By aggregating and organizing lists of the most interesting job offers, Remote Arround aims to facilitate a seamless match between talented professionals and forward-thinking companies.</p>

          <h2><a href="#acc2">"Historical" Context</a></h2>
          <p>This job board was initially developed with the sole focus on pure remote work, hence the name and domain being Remote Around. After a while, due to a lack of remote job opportunities, I decided to include all kinds of vacancies, including remote, hybrid, and non-remote positions. However, this job board still gives more attention to remote and flexible job opportunities, whether geographic or in terms of hourly flexibility. It is a remote-first job board.

          <h2><a href="#acc3">Social Impact</a></h2>
          <p>Additionally, we (I) aim to promote inclusion and equal rights for every candidate.

            Also, I work hard every day to fix minor and major bugs. I do my best to listen to my visitors' feedback to develop my products and services based on their input. After all, this platform is for my users.</p>
